            <p class="text" id="paragraph">I am Vince Jermaine Ilagan, a graduating Computer Science student with a strong interest in frontend software engineering and web development. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, Figma, etc. I also have a good background with other programming languages like Python, C, and Java. Aside from technical skills, through academic and personal projects, I have developed skills that involved good communication, collaboration, leadership, and many other soft skills essential to creating useful outputs. I am eager to apply my skills in a professional environment and continue to grow as a frontend software engineer while also contributing to meaningful digital products.</p>
